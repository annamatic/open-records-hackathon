Hello!

### Defining User Roles:

| Newbie Requester | Pro Requester |  
|------------------|------------------|
| Someone who has a specific or unique problem and is looking for information to help solve it. Examples of a Newbie Requester: Crime Victim, Neighborhood/Community Advocate (for ex. neighborhood crime watch group), Concerned Parent. The Newbie Requester lacks global and specific knowledge of how city agencies work or interact. He may lack understanding of which agency would address his concerns. He may lack understanding of what kinds of information are held in agency records. | Someone who regularly makes FOIL records requests (although may be new to requesting online). Examples of a Pro Requester: Attorney, Investigative Journalist, Neighborhood/Community Advocate Groups (for ex. Straphangers Campaign, See Through NY) |
| Mr. Chan, 67 | Mr. Smith, 48 |
| had reported a broken window on his shopfront to the police a week ago and would like a copy of the police report for his insurance company. Mr. Chan owns a grocery store in Ridgewood. He uses his iPhone regularly to text message, watch videos and see photos of his grandchildren, but is not very web savvy in terms of filling out forms or purchasing things online. For those tasks, he tends to ask his teenage son for help. He heard from a customer that he can request the copy of the police report online and he asked his son to find out how. His son Googled and found Open Records. | is seeking any past disciplinary records for two police officers M.B. and L.K. He has made many FOIL requests before, but this is his first time using the Open Records site to do it. He is an investigative journalist, currently writing for Sunshine News, with 15 years experience. Mr. Smith considers himself relatively technically savvy (he uses email and texts often, uses Uber, is very familiar with Word and Excel and does online banking). However, with 15 years experience in investigative reporting, he's been making FOIL requests, mostly to the Police Department and the Office of the Medical Examiner for many years and  he feels like he “knows what works.” Most of his FOIL requests, until a few years ago, have been submitted by mail using a Word document template that he customizes. Now he submits them by email. About 20% of his requests are successful but most are not. He feels he has a good sense of the kind of information he needs to include in his requests to optimize success. He keeps a spreadsheet tracking his FOIL requests. |
| Ms. Nelson, 43 | Ms. Oslow, 35 |
| has heard rumors about serious disciplinary trouble at her family's zoned middle school, and wants to see if the rumors are founded. She is not sure what kinds of records might exist, but thinks that there “must be something” that she could see from a city agency.Ms. Nelson,  is a single working mother of an 10 year old. Next year her son will be attending middle school. Their zoned middle school has had a "bad reputation” with occasional rumors among certain vocal neighborhood parents about violence and disciplinary trouble that have been escalating and complaints about a specific teacher. The school itself has never formally admitted these problems to concerned parents. She is strongly considering moving so that her son can go to a better school, but she wants to see if there are documents that can support or allay her fears. She hasn’t had much time to do research about the schools in her neighborhood due to working full time. She does many errands (groceries, shopping, taxes) online at night right before bed. Her librarian told her about FOIL so she Googled it online. This is her first time making a FOIL request. | is seeking all 311 complaint records for 3 different buildings managed by XYZ. She will also need to obtain any records of building violations related to these 3 buildings. Ms. Oslow a young attorney with 5 years experience. Sometimes her paralegal assists her with FOIL requests and sometimes she does them herself. She does most of her FOIL requests online by emailing a letter to the relevant Records Officer. The Records Officers for several city agencies are in her contacts list. She has made many FOIL requests before, but this is her first time using the Open Records site to do it. She is currently representing a client in a personal injury lawsuit against a building management company. |
