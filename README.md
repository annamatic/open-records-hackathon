### User Roles:

| Newbie Requester | Pro Requester |  
|------------------|------------------|
| Someone who has has never made a FOIL Request before on- or off-line. The Newbie Requester may lack knowledge of: how city agencies work or interact, which agency would address his concerns, and/or what kinds of information are held in agency records. *Examples of a Newbie Requester: Crime Victim, Neighborhood/Community Advocate (for ex. neighborhood crime watch group), Concerned Parent.* | Someone who has made FOIL records requests before, most probably as a part of his or her job. The Pro Requester may be new to requesting online. *Examples of a Pro Requester: Attorney, Investigative Journalist, Neighborhood or Community Advocate Groups (for ex. Straphangers Campaign, See Through NY)* |

### User Stories and Personas:

| **A. Mr. Chan, 67** | **C. Mr. Smith, 48** |
|------------------|------------------|
| *would like a copy of the police report he made for a broken window on his storefront for his insurance company.* | *is seeking any past disciplinary records for two police officers M.B. and L.K.* | 
| <small>Mr. Chan owns a grocery store in Ridgewood. His window was broken several years ago too, and that time he remembers he filled out some kind of paper form to get copy of the police report for insurance. This time he wants to do it online because "the Internet is faster." He's "not so good at the Internet" so his teenage son is helping him. Together they Googled and came across Open Records.</small> | <small>Mr. Smith has made many FOIL Requests before, but this is his first time using the Open Records site to do it. He is an investigative journalist with 15 years experience. Mr. Smith's FOIL Requests have been mostly to the Police Department and the Office of the Medical Examiner via printed and mailed letters. He keeps a spreadsheet tracking his FOIL requests.</small> |

| **B. Ms. Nelson, 43** | **D. Ms. Oslow, 35** |
|------------------|------------------|
| *would like to see personnel records for a specific teacher at the zoned middle school in her neighborhood.* | *is seeking all 311 complaint records for 3 different buildings managed by XYZ.* | 
| <small>Ms. Nelson is a part of a parents' group in her neighborhood in District 24. Her son will be attending their zoned middle school next year. She has heard 2nd-hand that many other parents had complained about one of the teachers, but the schoool's parent coordinator would not confirm it. She might put her son in the nearby Catholic school next year because of her concerns. Because she works full-time, she has to do her online research at night.</small> | <small>Ms. Oslow is a young attorney with 5 years experience. Sometimes her paralegal assists her with FOIL requests and sometimes she does them herself. In the past, she has emailed her FOIL Requests to the relevant Records Officer, but she thinks that doing it on Open Records might help her keep track of them. She is currently representing a client in a personal injury lawsuit against a building management company.</small> |

### User Goals:
1. **On the Homepage, I can see that...**
  - this is a place to submit Requests for documents from the city government. 
  - if I enter what I’m looking for in the search bar, I will get information about how to submit a Request for it. 
  - some Requests are successful and others are not.
  - I can view current and past Requests.
  - I can make my own Request.

2. **From my Search Results and in the Knowledgbase, I can see...**
  - which city agency supplies the records that I’m looking for
  - that not all requests are successful and that this has something to do with what information I put in the request. 
  - advice about what information to include in my specific request to improve my chances of success.

3. **On the View Requests page, I can see that...**
  - I can view all the past requests, filter them by agency, keyword, date range and/or status and outcome.
  - I can sort and scan the resulting requests easily, and I can tell from the Title of each Request what the contents are. 
  - there are two possible statuses for Requests: Opened or Closed. 
  - there are two possible outcomes for Opened Requests: Waiting or Processing.
  - there are two possible outcomes for Closed Requests: Completed or Denied.
  - if Closed Requests are Denied, I can see what the reason was. 
  - if Closed Requests are Completed, I can see how the documents were delivered and if documents are attached.
  - with the above features, I can quickly see if there is a Request here that will meet my needs. 
  - when I filter the Requests by Agency I can see data about that Agency: how long it takes for them to close requests and what their completed/denied rates are. 
  - when I filter the Requests according to Keywords in the Summary, I can scan to see how many were denied and for what reason.
  - I can check the status of an existing Request by tracking it with a FOIL ID#. 
  
3. **On the Make a Request page, I can see that...**
  - the information required in the form fall into 5 steps, and I can tell at each step whether the information will be public or private.
  - I can check the Knowledge Base for specific information to fill out the Summary and the Description in the best way. 
  - at the final step, at least 1 form of contact information will be required.
